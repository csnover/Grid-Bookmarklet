# Grid Overlay Bookmarklet

## About

This bookmarklet, once activated, overlays a customisable grid onto the current page. This can be very useful for web designers trying to line up content, or typographers trying to create vertical rhythm.

## Installation

Visit the project page, then drag the bookmarklet into your bookmarks toolbar.

## Usage

Click the bookmarklet and wait a few seconds for it to load. The HUD can be dragged around the page into a convenient location. To change a setting, type the new value into the text box, then *click/tab to another text box to update the grid*.
